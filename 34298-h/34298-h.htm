<div class="poem"><div class="cen">
<span class="i0"><b>I.</b><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O'er royal London, in luxuriant May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While lamps yet twinkled, dawning crept the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home from the hell the pale-eyed gamester steals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home from the ball flash jaded Beauty's wheels;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lean grimalkin, who, since night began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath hymn'd to love amidst the wrath of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scared from his raptures by the morning star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flits finely by, and threads the area bar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From fields suburban rolls the early cart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As rests the revel, so awakes the mart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transfusing Mocha from the beans within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright by the crossing gleams the alchemic tin,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There halts the craftsman; there, with envious sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The houseless vagrant looks, and limps foot-weary by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Behold that street,&mdash;the Omphalos of Town!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the grim palace wears the prison's frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mindful still, amidst a gaudier race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the veil'd Genius of the mournful Place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of floors no majesty but Griefs had trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weary limbs that only knelt to God.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">What tales, what morals, of the elder day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If stones had language&mdash;could that street convey!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why yell the human bloodhounds panting there?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drown the Stuart's last forgiving prayer.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 2]</span><span class="i0">Again the bloodhounds!&mdash;whither would they run?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lick the feet of Stuart's ribald son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, through the dusk-red towers, amidst his ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Vans and Mynheers, rode the Dutchman king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there&mdash;did England's Goneril thrill to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shouts that triumph'd o'er her crownless Lear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, where the gaslight streams on Crockford's door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bluff Henry chuckled at the jests of More;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, where you gaze upon the last H. B.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift paused, and mutter'd, "Shall I have that see?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, where yon pile, for party's common weal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knits votes that serve, with hearts abhorring, Peel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blunt Walpole seized, and roughly bought, his man;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, tired of Polly, St. John lounged to Anne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, let the world change on,&mdash;still must endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Earth is Earth, one changeless race&mdash;the Poor!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within that street, on yonder threshold stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sits as stone-like?&mdash;Penury, claim thine own!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sate, the homeless wanderer,&mdash;with calm eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking through tears, yet lifted to the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wistful, but patient, sorrowful, but mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As asking God when He would claim his child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A face too youthful for so hush'd a grief;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worm that gnaw'd the core had spared the leaf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though worn the cheek, with hunger, or with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still the soft fresh childlike bloom was there;<br /></span>

been deeply impressed with the mournful character of the mythological
Elysium. Even the few admitted to the groves of asphodel, unpurified by

mythology implied, was not entertained by the multitude. Plato remarked
that few, even in his day, had faith in the immortality of the soul; and indeed
the Hades of the ancients was not for the Many. Amongst those condemned
we find few criminals, except the old Titans, and such as imitated them in the
one crime&mdash;blasphemy to the fabled gods: and the dwellers of Elysium are

him to name the child as if it were a stranger to his blood. If he says, "I
leave to John Tompson, of Baker-street, &pound;10,000," John Tompson may
probably get the legacy; if he says, "I leave to my son, John Tompson, of
Baker-street, &pound;10,000," and the said John Tompson <i>is</i> his son (<i>a natural one</i>),
it is a hundred to one if John Tompson ever touches a penny! Up springs
the Inhuman Law, with its multiform obstacles, quibbles, and objections&mdash;proof
of identity&mdash;evidence of birth!&mdash;Many and many a natural child has thus
been robbed and swindled out of his sole claim upon redress&mdash;his sole chance
of subsistence. In most civilised countries a father is permitted to own the
offspring, whom, unless he do so, he has wronged at its very birth&mdash;whom, if
he do not so, he wrongs irremedially; with us the error is denied reparation,
and the innocence is sentenced to outlawry. Our laws, with relation to illegitimate
children, are more than unjust&mdash;they are inhuman.</p></div>

<span class="i1">On Avon's stream, in day's declining hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loitering Angler sees reflected towers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown the hill the stately shadows glide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And force their frown upon the gentle tide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another shade, as stately and as slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steals down the slope and dims the peace below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, side by side, your noiseless shadows fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time-wearied Lord, and time-defying hall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Song's sweet Master fled the roar of Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Bandusian fount and Sabine home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soul forsook the beaten tracks of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought the lone bye-path and escaped the strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paused, reviving 'mid the haunts of youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To conjure fancies back, or muse on truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One home there is, from which, howe'er we stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True as a star, the smile pursues our way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The home of thoughtful childhood's mystic tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of earliest Sabbath bells on sinless ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of noonday dreamings under summer trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayers first murmur'd at a mother's knees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! happy he, whose later home as man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is made where Love first spoke, and Hope began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where haunted floors dear footsteps back can give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in our Lares all our fathers live!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Less for ancestral greatness than its own:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor heed what casework clasps the picture round.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">But who can guess that crisis of the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the old glory first forsakes the goal?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Knowledge halts and sees but cloud before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sour'd Experience whispers 'hope no more;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every onward footstep from our side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parts the slow friend or hesitating guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When envy rots the harvest in the sheaf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When faith in virtue seems the child's belief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life's last music sighs itself away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On some false lip, that kiss'd but to betray?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus from a world that wrong'd him, self-exiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man resought the birthplace of the child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest comes betimes, if toil commence too soon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brightest sun is stillest at the noon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary at mid-day, genius halts the course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hails the respite which renews the force.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Still shakes the urn, although the lots are gold:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wit without effort, beauty worn with ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The courtier's mien to veil the miser's soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that self-love which brings such self-control.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High-born, but poor, no Corydon was he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dream of love and cots in Arcady;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Easier to blame the elements unkind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The distant clime, the ocean, and the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think them all leagued to intercept the scroll,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To hide remembrance lest it seem'd regret;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in her looks this comfort still might be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Father, I smile&mdash;and joy yet lives for thee!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Seaton deem'd her childish fancy flown;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">The later summer in that second spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the turf glistens with the fairy ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When oak and elm assume a livelier green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And starry buds on water-flowers are seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When parent nests the new-fledged goldfinch leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earliest song in airiest meshes weaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fields wave undulous with golden corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And August fills his Amalth&aelig;an horn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The later summer shone on Ruthven's towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lord and wife (with guests to cheer the hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not faced alone) to that grey pile return'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harcourt with these, and Seaton, who had learn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eno' to call him from his world of strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch that Home which makes the Woman's life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not ev'n to Juliet Constance had betray'd<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A dying parent needed Juliet's care,                   <span class='rbrace'>}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In climes where Death comes soft&mdash;in Tuscan air.       <span class='rbrace'>}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And least to Seaton would his child have shown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One hidden wound; her heart still spared his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the father trembling at her side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the smooth tempter, not the watchful guide,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw through the quicksands flow each sever'd life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the cold Lord and there the courted wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fearful, wrathful&mdash;yet uncertain still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For warning ofttimes makes more sure the ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fires suspicion to believe the worst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or bids temptation be more fondly nurst;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]</span><span class="i0">Nought ripens evil like too prompt a blame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His prudence watchful, and his fears supprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to learn what fault, if fault were there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had outlaw'd Constance from a husband's care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the heart (the soul's frail fort) unbarr'd,<br /></span>

<h2>MILTON.<br /><br />

IN FOUR PARTS.</h2>



<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 118]</span></p>
<h4>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</h4>

<p>This Poem was originally composed in very early youth. It was first
published in 1831, and though unfortunately coupled with a very jejune and
puerile burlesque called 'The Siamese Twins' (which to my great satisfaction
has been long since forgotten), it was honoured by a very complimentary
notice in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and found general favour with those who
chanced to read it. In the present edition, although the conception and the
general structure remain the same, many passages have been wholly re-written,
and the diction throughout carefully revised, and often materially
altered. I have sought, in short, from an affection for the subject (too partial
it may be) to give to the ideas which visited me in the freshness of youth,
whatever aid from expression they could obtain in the taste and culture of
mature manhood. No doubt, however, faults of exuberance in form, as in
fancy, still remain, and betray the age in which we scarcely look beyond the
Spring that delights us, nor comprehend that the multitude of the blossoms
can be injurious to the bearing of the tree. Nevertheless, such faults may
find more indulgence among my younger readers than those of an opposite
nature, incident to the style, closer and more compressed, which my present
theories of verse have led me to adopt in most of the poems I have
composed of late years.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the design of this poem is that of a picture. It is
intended to portray the great Patriot Poet in the three cardinal divisions
of life&mdash;Youth, Manhood, and Age. The first part is founded upon the well-known,
though ill-authenticated, tradition of the Italian lady or ladies seeing
Milton asleep under a tree in the gardens of his college, and leaving some
tributary verses beside the sleeper. Taking full advantage of this legend, and
presuming to infer from Milton's Italian verses (as his biographers have done
before me) that in his tour through Italy he did not escape the influence of the
master passion, I have ventured to connect, by a single thread of romantic
fiction, the segments of a poem in which narrative after all is subservient to
description. This idea belongs to the temerity of youth, but I trust it has
been subjected to restrictions more reverent than those ordinarily imposed on
poetic licence.</p>

<h4>CROMWELL'S DREAM.</h4>



<div class="blockquot"><p>The conception of this Ode originated in a popular tradition of Cromwell's
earlier days. It is thus strikingly related by Mr. Forster, in his very valuable
Life of Cromwell:&mdash;"He laid himself down, too fatigued in hope for sleep,
when suddenly the curtains of his bed were slowly withdrawn by a gigantic
figure, which bore the aspect of a woman, and which, gazing at him silently
for a while, told him that he should, before his death, be the greatest man in
England. He remembered when he told the story, and the recollection marked
the current of his thoughts, <i>that the figure had not made mention of the word
King</i>." Alteration has been made in the scene of the vision, and the age of
Cromwell.</p></div>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>


<p>In prefixing to this poem a brief explanation of its design, I feel
myself involuntarily compelled to refer to the more popular distinctions
of Epic Fable, though I do not thereby presume to arrogate to my
work that title of Epic which Time alone has the prerogative to confer.</p>

<p>Pope has, accurately and succinctly, defined the three cardinal divisions
of Epic Fable to consist in the Probable, the Allegorical, and the
Marvellous. For the Probable is indispensable to the vital interest of
the action, the Marvellous is the obvious domain of creative invention,
and the Allegorical is the most pleasing mode of insinuating some
subtler truth, or clothing some profounder moral.</p>

<p>I accept these divisions, because they conform to the simplest principles
of rational criticism; and though their combination does not
form an Epic, it serves at least to amplify the region and elevate the
objects of Romance.</p>

<p>It has been my aim so to blend these divisions, that each may harmonize
with the other, and all conduce to the end proposed from the
commencement. I have admitted but little episodical incident, and
none that does not grow out of what Pope terms "the platform of the
story." For the marvellous agencies I have not presumed to make
direct use of that Divine Machinery which the war of the Christian
Principle with the form of Heathenism might have suggested to the
sublime daring of Milton, had he prosecuted his original idea of founding
an heroic poem upon the legendary existence of Arthur;&mdash;and, on
the other hand, the Teuton Mythology, however imaginative and profound,
is too unfamiliar and obscure, to permit its employment as an
open and visible agency;&mdash;such reference to it as occurs, is therefore
rather admitted as an appropriate colouring to the composition, than
made an integral part of the materials of the canvas: and, not to ask
from the ordinary reader an erudition I should have no right to expect,
the reference so made is in the simplest form, and disentangled from
the necessity of other information than a few brief notes will suffice
to afford.</p>

<p>In taking my subject from chivalrous romance, I take, then, those
agencies from the Marvellous which chivalrous romance naturally and
familiarly affords&mdash;the Fairy, the Genius, the Enchanter: not wholly,
indeed, in the precise and literal spirit with which our nursery tales
receive those creations of Fancy through the medium of French
Fabliaux, but in the larger significations by which, in their conceptions
of the Supernatural, our fathers often implied the secrets of
Nature. For the Romance from which I borrow is the Romance of
the North&mdash;a Romance, like the Northern mythology, full of typical
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 195]</span>
meaning and latent import. The gigantic remains of symbol-worship
are visible amidst the rude fables of the Scandinavians, and what little
is left to us of the earlier and more indigenous literature of the
Cymrians, is characterized by a mysticism profound with parable.
This fondness for an interior or double meaning is the most prominent
attribute in that Romance popularly called The Gothic, the feature
most in common with all creations that bear the stamp of the Northern
fancy: we trace it in the poems of the Anglo-Saxons; it returns to us,
in our earliest poems after the Conquest; it does not <i>originate</i> in the
Oriental genius (immemorially addicted to Allegory), but it instinctively
<i>appropriates</i> all that Saraconic invention can suggest to the
more sombre imagination of the North&mdash;it unites to the Serpent of the
Edda the flying Griffin of Arabia, the Persian Genius to the Scandinavian
Trold,&mdash;and wherever it accepts a marvel, it seeks to insinuate
a type. This peculiarity, which distinguishes the spiritual essence of
the modern from the sensual character of ancient poetry, especially the
Roman, is visible wherever a tribe allied to the Goth, the Frank, or the
Teuton, carries with it the deep mysteries of the Christian faith. Even
in sunny Provence it transfuses a subtler and graver moral into the lays
of the joyous troubadour,<a name="FNanchor_A_57" id="FNanchor_A_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_57" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;and weaves "The Dance of Death" by the
joyous streams, and through the glowing orange-groves, of Spain. Onwards,
this under-current of meaning flowed, through the various
phases of civilization:&mdash;it pervaded alike the popular Satire and the
dramatic Mystery;&mdash;and, preserving its thoughtful calm amidst all the
stirring passions that agitated mankind in the age subsequent to the
Reformation, not only suffused the luxuriant fancy of the dreamy
Spenser, but communicated to the practical intellect of Shakspere
that subtle and recondite wisdom which seems the more inexhaustible
the more it is examined, and suggests to every new inquirer some new
problem in the philosophy of Human Life. Thus, in taking from
Northern Romance the Marvellous, we are most faithful to the genuine
character of that Romance, when we take with the Marvellous its old
companion, the Typical or Allegorical. But these form only two divisions
of the three which I have assumed as the components of the unity
I seek to accomplish; there remains the Probable, which contains the
Actual. To subject the whole poem to allegorical constructions would
be erroneous, and opposed to the vital principle of a work of this kind,
which needs the support of direct and human interest. The inner and
the outer meaning of Fable should flow together, each acting on the
other, as the thought and the action in the life of a man. It is true that in
order clearly to interpret the action, we should penetrate to the thought.
But if we fail of that perception, the action, though less comprehended,
still impresses its reality on our senses, and make its appeal to our
interest.</p>

<p>I have thus sought to maintain the Probable through that chain of
incident in which human agencies are employed, and through those
agencies the direct action of the Poem is accomplished; while the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 196]</span>
Allegorical admits into the Marvellous the introduction of that subtler
form of Truth, which if less positive than the Actual, is wider in its
application, and ought to be more profound in its significance.</p>

<p>For the rest, it may perhaps be conceded that this poem is not
without originality in the conception of its plot and the general treatment
of its details. I am not aware of any previous romantic poem
which it resembles in its main design, or in the character of its principal
incidents;&mdash;and, though I may have incurred certain mannerisms of
my own day, I yet venture to trust that, in the pervading form or style,
the mind employed has been sufficiently in earnest to leave its own
peculiar effigy and stamp upon the work. For the incidents narrated,
I may, indeed, thank the nature of my subject, if many of them could
scarcely fail to be new. The celebrated poets of chivalrous fable&mdash;Ariosto,
Tasso, and Spenser, have given to their scenery the colourings
of the West. The Great North from which Chivalry sprung&mdash;its polar
seas, its natural wonders, its wild legends, its antediluvian remains&mdash;(wide
fields for poetic description and heroic narrative)&mdash;have been,
indeed, not wholly unexplored by poetry, but so little appropriated,
that even after Tegner and Oehlenschl&auml;ger, I dare to hope that I have
found tracks in which no poet has preceded me, and over which yet
breathes the native air of our National Romance.</p>

<p>For the Manners preserved through this poem, I naturally reject
those which the rigid Antiquary would appropriate to the date of that
Historical Arthur, of whom we know so little, and take those of the age
in which the Arthur of Romance, whom we know so well, revived into
fairer life at the breath of Minstrel and Fabliast. The anachronism of
chivalrous manners and costume for the British chief and his Knighthood,
is absolutely required by all our familiar associations. On the
other hand, without affecting any precise accuracy in details, I have
kept the country of the brave Prince of the Silures (or South Wales)
somewhat more definitely in view, than has been done by the French
Romance writers; while in portraying his Saxon foes, I have endeavoured
to distinguish their separate nationality, without enforcing too
violent a contrast between the rudeness of the heathen Teutons and the
<i>polished Christianity of the Cymrian Knighthood</i>.<a name="FNanchor_B_58" id="FNanchor_B_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_58" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 197]</span></p>
<p>May I be permitted to say a word as to the metre I have selected?&mdash;One
advantage it has,&mdash;that while thoroughly English, and not uncultivated
by the best of the elder masters, it has never been applied to
a poem of equal length, and has not been made too trite and familiar,
by the lavish employment of recent writers.<a name="FNanchor_C_59" id="FNanchor_C_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_59" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Shakspere has taught
us its riches in the Venus and Adonis,&mdash;Spenser in The Astrophel,&mdash;Cowley
has sounded its music amidst the various intonations of his
irregular lyre. But of late years, if not wholly laid aside, it has been
generally neglected for the more artificial and complicated Spenserian
stanza, which may seem, at the first glance, to resemble it, but which
to the ear is widely different in rhythm and construction.</p>

<p>The reader may perhaps remember that Dryden has spoken with
emphatic praise of the "quatrain, or stanza of four in alternate
rhyme." He says indeed, "that he had ever judged it more noble,
and of greater dignity, both for the sound and number, than any other
verse in use amongst us." That metre, in its simple integrity, is comprised
in the stanza selected, ending in the vigour and terseness of the
rhyming couplet, with which, for the most part, the picture should be
closed or the sense clenched. And whatever the imperfection of my
own treatment of this variety in poetic form, I hazard a prediction that
it will be ultimately revived into more frequent use, especially in narrative,
and that its peculiar melodies of rhythm and cadence, as well as the
just and measured facilities it affords to expression, neither too diffuse
nor too restricted, will be recognized hereafter in the hands of a more
accomplished master of our language.</p>

<p>Here ends all that I feel called upon to say respecting a Poem which
I now acknowledge as the child of my most cherished hopes, and to
which I deliberately confide the task to uphold, and the chance to
continue, its father's name.</p>

<p>To this work, conceived first in the enthusiasm of youth, I have
patiently devoted the best powers of my maturer years;&mdash;if it be
worthless, it is at least the worthiest contribution that my abilities
enable me to offer to the literature of my country; and I am unalterably
convinced, that on this foundation I rest the least perishable
monument of those thoughts and those labours which have made the
life of my life.</p>

which appeared to me absolutely necessary in explanation of the text.
Among the notes omitted, was one appended to Book I., which defended
at some length, and by numerous examples, two alleged peculiarities of
style or mannerism:&mdash;I content myself here with stating briefly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 198]</span></p>
<p>1st.&mdash;That in this work (as in my later ones generally) I have adopted
what appears to me to have been the practice of Gray (judging from
the editions of his Poems revised by himself), in the use of the capital
initial. I prefix it&mdash;</p>

<p>First, to every substantive that implies a personification; thus War,
Fame, &amp;c., may in one line take the small initial as mere nouns, and in
another line the capital initial, to denote that they are intended as personifications.
This rule is clear&mdash;all personifications may be said to
represent proper names: love, with a small l, means but a passion or
affection; with a large L, Love represents some mythological power
that presides over the passion or affection, and is as much a proper
name as Venus, Eros, Camdeo, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Secondly, I prefix the capital in those rare instances in which an
adjective is used as a noun; as the Unknown, the Obscure,<a name="FNanchor_D_60" id="FNanchor_D_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_60" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> &amp;c. The
capital here but answers the use of all printed inventions, in simplifying
to the reader the author's meaning. If it be printed "he passed through
the obscure," the reader naturally looks for the noun that is to follow
the adjective; if the capital initial be used, as "He passed through the
Obscure," the eye conveys to the mind without an effort the author's
intention to use the adjective as a substantive.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I prefix the capital initial where it serves to give an individual
application to words that might otherwise convey only a general
meaning; for instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Or his who loves the madding Nymphs to lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the Fork'd Hill.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that is, the Forked Hill, <i>par emphasis</i>,&mdash;Parnassus.</p>

<p>The use of the capital in these instances seems to me warranted by
common sense, and the best authorities in the minor niceties of our
language.</p>

<p>With regard to the other point referred to in the omitted note, I
would observe, that I have deliberately used the freest licence in the
rapid change of tense from past to present, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>; as a privilege
essential to all ease, spirit, force, and variety, in narrative poetry; and
warranted by the uniform practice of Pope, Dryden, and Milton. I
subjoin a few examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the last quotation, brief as it is, the tense changes six times.</p>

<p>I ask indulgence of the reader if I take this occasion to add a very
short comment upon three objections to this poem which have been
brought under my notice:&mdash;</p>

<p>1&mdash;that it contains too much learning; 2&mdash;that it abounds too
much with classical allusions; 3&mdash;that it indulges in rare words or
archaisms.</p>

<p>I wish I could plead guilty to the honourable charge that it contains
too much learning. A distinguished critic has justly observed, that the
greatest obstacle which the modern writer attempting an Epic would
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 200]</span>
have to encounter, would be, in his utter impossibility to attain the
requisite learning. For an Epic ought to embody the whole learning
of the period in which it is composed; and in the present age that is
beyond the aspiration of the most erudite scholar or the profoundest
philosopher. Still, any attempt at an Heroic Poem must at least comprise
all the knowledge which the nature of the subject will admit, and
we cannot but observe that the greatest narrative poems are those in
which the greatest amount of learning is contained. Beyond all comparison
the most learned poems that exist, in reference to the age in
which they are composed, are the "Iliad" and "Odyssey;" next to
them, the "Paradise Lost;" next to that, the "&AElig;neid," in which the
chief charm of the six latter books is in that "exquisite erudition,"
which M&uuml;ller so discriminately admires in Virgil; and after these,
in point of learning, come perhaps the "Divine Comedy," and the
"Fairy Queen." So that I have only to regret my deficiency of learning,
rather than to apologize for the excess of it.</p>

<p>With regard to the classical allusions which I have permitted myself,
I might shelter my practice under the mantles of our great masters in
heroic song&mdash;Milton and Spenser; but in fact such admixture of the
Classic with the Gothic muse is so essentially the characteristic of the
minstrelsy of the middle ages, that without a liberal use of the same combination,
I could not have preserved the colouring proper to my subject.
And, indeed, I think the advice which one of the most elegant of modern
critics has given to the painter, is equally applicable to the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Non te igitur lateant antiqua numismata, gemm&aelig;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quodque refert specie veterum post s&aelig;cula mentem;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Splendidior quippe ex illis assurgit imago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Magnaque se rerum facies aperit meditanti."<a name="FNanchor_F_62" id="FNanchor_F_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_62" class="fnanchor">[F]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lastly, the moderate use of archaisms has always been deemed admissible
in a narrative poem of some length, and rather perhaps an
ornament than a defect, where the action of the poem is laid in remote
antiquity. And I may add that not only the revival of old, but the
invention of new words, if sparingly resorted to, is among the least
contestable of poetic licences&mdash;a licence freely recognized by Horace,
elaborately maintained by Dryden, and tacitly sanctioned, age after
age, by the practice of every poet by whom our language has been
enriched. I have certainly not abused either of these privileges, for
while I have only adopted three new words of foreign derivation, I do
not think there are a dozen words in the whole poem which can be
considered archaisms: and in the three or four instances in which such
words are not to be found in Milton, Shakspere, or Spenser, they are
taken from the Saxon element of our language, and are still popularly
used in the northern parts of the island, in which that Saxon element
is more tenaciously preserved.</p>

<p>If these matters do not seem to the reader of much importance, in
reference to a poem of this design and extent, I will own to him confidentially,
that I incline to his opinion. But I have met with no
objections to the general composition of this work, more serious than
those to which the above remarks are intended to reply. Some objections
to special lines or stanzas which appeared to me prompted by a
juster criticism, or which occurred to myself in reperusal, I have
carefully endeavoured in this edition to remove.</p>

represented it such as it really appears to have been,&mdash;not as the sovereign of
all Britain, and the conquering invader of Europe (according to the groundless
fable of Geoffrey of Monmouth), but as the patriot Prince of South Wales,
resisting successfully the invasion of his own native soil, and accomplishing
the object of his career in preserving entire the nationality of his Welsh countrymen.
In thus contracting his sphere of action to the bounds of rational
truth, his dignity, both moral and poetic, is obviously enhanced. Represented
as the champion of all Britain against the Saxons, his life would have been but
a notorious and signal failure; but as the preserver of the Cymrian Nationality&mdash;of
that part of the British population which took refuge in Wales, he has a
claim to the epic glory of success.
</p><p>
It is for this latter reason that I have gone somewhat out of the strict letter
of history, in the poetical licence by which the Mercians are represented as
Arthur's principal enemies (though, properly speaking, the Mercian kingdom
was not then founded): the alliance between the Mercian and the Welsh,
which concludes the Poem&mdash;is at least not contrary to the spirit of History&mdash;since
in very early periods such amicable bonds between the Welsh and the Mercians
were contracted, and the Welsh, on the whole, were on better terms with
those formidable borderers than with the other branches of the Saxon family.</p></div>

<h2>NOTES TO KING ARTHUR.</h2>

<h4>BOOK I.</h4>


<div class="endnote"><p class="center"><a name="Footnote_1_63" id="Footnote_1_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_63">1.&mdash;Page 201, stanza iv.</a></p>

</div></div>
<p>
The Carduel of the <span class="smcap">Fabliaux</span> is not easily ascertained: it is here
identified with Caerleon on the Usk, the favourite residence of Arthur,
according to the Welch poets. This must have been a city of no
ordinary splendour in the supposed age of Arthur, while still fresh
from the hands of the Roman; since, so late as the twelfth century,
Giraldus Cambrensis, in his well-known description, speaks as an
eye-witness of the many vestiges of its former splendour. "Immense
palaces, ornamented with gilded roofs, in imitation of Roman magnificence,
a tower of prodigious size, remarkable hot baths, relics
of temples," &amp;c. (Giraldus Cambrensis, Sir R. Hoare's translation,
vol. i. p. 103.) Geoffrey of Monmouth (1. ix. c. 12) also mentions,
admiringly, the gilt roofs of Caerleon, a subject on which he might be a
little more accurate than in those other details in his notable chronicle,
not drawn from the same ocular experience. The luxurious Romans,
indeed, had bequeathed to the chiefs of Britain abodes of splendour
and habits of refinement which had no parallel in the Saxon domination.
Sir F. Palgrave truly remarks, that even in the fourteenth century the
edifices raised in Britain by the Romans were so numerous and costly
as almost to excel any others on this side of the Alps. Caerleon (Isca
Augusta) was the Roman capital of Siluria, the garrison of the renowned
Second or Augustan legion, and the Palatian residence of the Pr&aelig;tor.
It was not, however, according to national authority, founded by the
Romans, but by the mythical Belin Mawr, three centuries before
C&aelig;sar's invasion. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the dragon
was the standard of the Cymry (a word, by the way, which I trust my
Welch readers will forgive me for spelling Cymri).</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Which <span class="smcap">Heus</span>, the Guardian, taught the Celt to wield.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Heus</span> is the same deity as <span class="smcap">Esus</span>, or <span class="smcap">Hesus</span>, mentioned in Lucan, the
Mars of the Celts. According to the Welch triads, <span class="smcap">Heus</span> (or <span class="smcap">Hu</span>&mdash;Hu
Gadarn; <i>i. e.</i> the mighty Guardian, or Inspector) brought the
people of Cymry first into this isle, from the summer country called
Defrobanni (in the Tauric Chersonese), over the Hazy Sea (the German
Ocean). Davies, in his Celtic Researches, observes that some commentator,
at least as old as the twelfth century, repeatedly explains the
situation of Defrobanni as "that on which Constantinople now stands."
"This comment," adds Davies, "would not have been made without
some authority; it belongs to an age which possessed many documents
relating to the history of the Britons which are now no longer extant."
</p><p>
It would be extremely important towards tracing the origin of the
Cymry, if authentic and indisputable records of such traditions of their
migration from the East can be found in their own legends at an age
before learned conjecture could avail itself of the passages in Herodotus
and Strabo, which relate to the Cimmerians, and tend to identify that
people with our Cymrian ancestors. We find in the first (1. i. c. 14),
that the Cimmerians, chased from their original settlements by the
Nomadic Scythians, came to Lydia, where they took Sardis (except the
citadel). In this account Strabo, on the authority of Callisthenes and
Callinus, confirms Herodotus.
</p><p>
In flying from their Scythian foes, the Cimmerians took their course
by the sea-coasts to Sinope, and the Cimmerian Bosphorus, and as, after
this flight, the old Cimmerian league was broken up, and the tribes
dispersed, this gives us the evident date for such migrations as
Hu Gadarn is supposed to head; and the coincidence between Welch
traditions (if genuinely ancient) and classical authority becomes very
remarkable. For the additional corroboration of the hypothesis thus
suggested, which is afforded by the identity between the Cimmerians
of Asia and the Cimbri of Gaul, see Strabo (1. vii. p. 424, the Oxford
edition, 1807). It is curious to note in Herodotus (1. iv. c. 11) that the
same domestic feuds which destroyed the Cymrian empire in Britain
destroyed the Cimmerians in their original home. While the Scythians
invaded them, they quarrelled amongst themselves whether to fight or
fly, and settled the dispute by fighting each other, and flying from the
enemy.</p></div>

</div></div>
<p>
Some liberty, in the course of this poem, will be taken with the
legendary character, less perhaps of the Gawaine of the Fabliaux, than
of the Gwalchmai (Hawk of Battle) of the Welch bards. In both,
indeed, this hero is represented as sage, courteous, and eloquent; but
he is a livelier character in the Fabliaux than in the tales of his native
land. The characters of many of the Cymrian heroes, indeed, vary
according to the caprice of the poets. Thus Kai, in the Triads, one of
the Three Diademed chiefs of battle and a powerful magician, is, in the
French romances, Messire Queux, the chief of the cooks; and in the
Mabinogion,<a name="FNanchor_A_76" id="FNanchor_A_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_76" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> he is at one time but an unlucky knight of more valour
than discretion, and at another time attains the dignity assigned to
him in the Triads, and exults in supernatural attributes. And poor
Gawaine himself, the mirror of chivalry, in most of the Fabliaux is, as
Southey observes, "shamefully calumniated" in the <span class="smcap">Mort D'Arthur</span>
as the "false Gawaine." The Caradoc of this poem is not intended to be
identified with the hero Caradoc Vreichvras. The name was sufficiently
common in Britain (it is the right reading for Caractacus) to allow to
the use of the poet as many Caradocs as he pleases.</p></div>

Caradoc's version of the descent of Brut differs somewhat from that
of Geoffrey of Monmouth, but perhaps it is quite as true. According
to Geoffrey, Brut is great-grandson to &AElig;neas, and therefore not expelled
from "<i>flaming</i> Troy." Caradoc follows his own (no doubt authentic)
legends, also, as to the aboriginal population of the island, which,
according to Geoffrey, were giants, not devils. The cursory and contemptuous
way in which that delicious romance-writer speaks of these
poor giants is inimitable&mdash;"<i>Albion a nemine, exceptis paucis gigantibus,

<p>
C&aelig;re of the twelve cities in the Etrurian league (though not
originally an Etrurian population), imparted to the Romans their
sacred mysteries: hence the word C&aelig;remonia. This holy city was in
close connection with Delphi. An interesting account of it under its
earlier name "Agylla," will be found in Sir W. Gell's "Topography of
Rome and its vicinity." The obscure passage in Plutarch's Life of
Sylla, which intimates that the Etrurian soothsayers had a forewarning
of the declining fates of their country, is well known to scholars; who
have made more of it than it deserves.
</p><p>
I may as well observe that the adjective <i>Lartian</i> is derived from
<i>Lars</i> (or lord), in contradistinction to the adjective <i>Larian</i> derived

Tina was the Jove of the Etrurians. The mode in which this people

The Augur made lines in the air due north, south, east, and west,
marked where the lines crossed upon the earth; then he and the chiefs
associated with him sate down, covered their heads, and waited some
approving omen from the gods. The Etrurian Augurs were celebrated

<p>
The Etrurians paid more respect to women than most of the classical
nations, and admitted females to the throne. The Augur (a purely
Etruscan name and office) was the highest power in the state. In the
earlier Etruscan history, the Augur and the king were unquestionably
united in one person. Latterly, this does not appear to have been
necessarily (nor perhaps generally) the case. The king (whether we
call him lars or lucumo), as well as the augur, was elected out of a
certain tribe, or clan; but in the strange colony described in the poem,
it is supposed that the rank has become hereditary in the family of the
chief who headed it, as would probably have been the case even in more
common-place settlements in another soil. Thus, the first Etrurian
colonist, Tarchun, no doubt had his successors in his own lineage.
</p><p>
I cannot assert that &AElig;gle is a purely Etruscan name; it is one
common both with the Greeks and Latins. In Apollodorus (ii. 5) it is
given to one of the Hesperides, and in Virgil (Eclog. vi. l. 20) to the
fairest of the Naiads, the daughter of the sun; but it is not contrary
to the conformation of the Etruscan language, as, by the way, many of
the most popular Latinized Etruscan words are, such as <i>Lucumo</i>, for
Lauchme; and even Porsena, or, as Virgil (contrary to other authorities)
spells and pronounces it, Pors[~e]nna (a name which has revived to
fresh fame in Mr. Macaulay's noble "Lays") is a sad corruption; for,
as both Niebuhr and Sir William G. remark, the Etruscans had no <i>o</i> in
their language. Pliny informs us that they supplied its place by the <i>v</i>.
I apprehend that an Etrurian would have spelt Porsena <i>Pvrsna</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_103" id="FNanchor_A_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_103" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p></div>

Whatever the original cradle of the mysterious Etrurians, scholars,
with one or two illustrious exceptions, are pretty well agreed that it
must have been <i>somewhere</i> in the East; and the more familiar we
become with the remains of their art, the stronger appears the evidence
of their early and intimate connection with the Egyptians, though in
themselves a race decidedly not Egyptian. See <span class="smcap">Micali</span>, <i>Stor. deg.

whom I am under many obligations in this part of my poem, I must
own, with such frankness as respect for so great an authority will
permit, that I think many of his assumptions are to be taken with
great qualification and reserve.</p></div>

</div></div>
<p>
Diodorus Siculus speaks with great respect of the <span class="smcap">Saronides</span> as the
Druid priests of Gaul; and Mr. Davis, in his Celtic Researches, insists
upon it that <i>Saronides</i> is a British word, compounded from <i>s&ecirc;r</i>, stars;
and <i>honydd,</i> "one who discriminates or points out:" in fine, according
to him, the Saronides are Seronyddion, i. e. <i>astronomers</i>. For the initiation
of Pythagoras into the Druid mysteries, see <span class="smcap">Clem. Alex</span>. <i>Strom.
L. i. Ex. Alex. Polyhist</i>. It will be observed that the author here
takes advantage of the well-known assertions of many erudite authorities
that the Ph&#339;nician language is the parent of the Celtic, in order
to obtain a channel of oral communication between Arthur and the
Etrurian;<a name="FNanchor_A_106" id="FNanchor_A_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_106" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> though, contented with those authorities, as sufficing for
all poetic purpose, he prudently declines entering into a controversy
equally abstruse and interminable, as to the affinity between the
countrymen of Dido and the scattered remnants of the Briton. It is
not surprising that the Augur should know Ph&#339;nician, for we have
only to suppose that he maintained, as well as he could in his retreat,
the knowledge common among his priestly forefathers. The intercourse
between Etruria and the Ph&#339;nician states (especially Carthage)
was too considerable not to have rendered the language of the last
familiar to the learning of the first;&mdash;to say nothing of those more
disputable affinities of origin and religion, which, if existing, would
have made an acquaintance with Ph&#339;nicia necessary to the solution
of their historical chronicles and sacred books. Nor, when the Augur
afterwards assures Arthur that &AElig;gle also understands Ph&#339;nician, is
any extravagant demand made upon the credulity of the indulgent
reader; for, those who have consulted such lights as research has
thrown upon Etrurian records, are aware that their more high-born
women appear to have received no ordinary mental cultivation.</p></div>

It is clear that all which the bewildered Augur could comprehend,
in the theological relations by which Arthur (no doubt with equal

in "worsting Satan," the Emperor of Greece is demolishing the Typhon
worship of the Egyptians, and enforcing the adoration of the Dorian
Apollo&mdash;that deity who had passed a probation on earth, and expiated
a mysterious sin by descending to the shades; and it would require a

Castel d'Asso (the Castellum Axia, in Cicero), the name now given to

Viterbo, was Voltumna (Fanum Voltumn&aelig;), at which the twelve
sovereigns of the twelve dynasties, and the other chiefs of the Etrurians,

<p>
If the celebrated controversy between Black and White, which divided
the Cymrian church in King Arthur's days, should seem to suggest a
parallel instance in our own,&mdash;the Author begs sincerely to say that he
is more inclined to grieve than to jest at a schism which threatens to
separate from so large a body of the upholders of the English church
the abilities and learning of no despicable portion of the English clergy.
There is a division more dangerous than that between theologian and
theologian&mdash;viz., a division between the Pastors and their flocks&mdash;between
the teaching of the pulpit and the sympathy of the audience.
Far from the Author be the rash presumption to hazard any opinion
as to matters of doctrine, on which&mdash;such as Regeneration by Baptism&mdash;it
cannot be expected that, for the sake of expediency or even concord,
the remarkable thinkers who have emerged from the schools of
Oxford should admit of compromise;&mdash;but he asks, with the respect

<p>
The testimony to be found in classical writers as to the original
purity of the Druid worship, before it was corrupted into the idolatry
which existed in Britain at the time of the Roman conquest, is strongly
corroborated by the Welsh triads. These triads, indeed, are of various
dates, but some bear the mark of a very remote antiquity&mdash;wholly distinct
alike from the philosophy of the Romans and the mode of thought
prevalent in the earlier ages of the Christian era; in short, anterior to
all the recorded conquests over the Cymrian people. These, like
proverbs, appear the wrecks and fragments of some prim&aelig;val ethics, or
philosophical religion. Nor are such remarkable alone for the purity
of the notions they inculcate relative to the Deity; they have often,
upon matters less spiritual, the delicate observation, as well as the
profound thought, of reflective wisdom. It is easy to see in them how
identified was the Bard with the Sage&mdash;that rare union which produces
the highest kind of human knowledge. Such, perhaps, are the relics of
that sublimer learning which, ages before the sacrifice of victims in
wicker idols, won for the Druids the admiration of the cautious
Aristotle, as ranking among the true enlighteners of men&mdash;such the
teachers who (we may suppose to have) instructed the mystical Pythagoras;
and furnished new themes for meditation to the musing
Brahman. Nor were the Druids of Britain inferior to those with whom
the Sages of the western and eastern world came more in contact. On
the contrary, even to the time of C&aelig;sar, the Druids of Britain excelled
in science and repute those in Gaul; and to their schools the Neophytes
of the Continent were sent.
</p><p>
In the Stanzas that follow the description of the more primitive
Cymrians, it is assumed that the rude Druid remains <i>now</i> existent (as
at Stonehenge, &amp;c.), are coeval only with the later and corrupted state
of a people degenerated to idol-worship, and that the Cymrians previously
possessed an architecture, of which no trace now remains, more
suited to their early civilization. If it be true that they worshipped the
Deity only in his own works, and that it was not until what had been a
symbol passed into an idol, that they deserted the mountain-top and
the forest for the temple, they would certainly have wanted the main
inducement to permanent and lofty architecture. Still it may be
allowed, at least to a poet, to suppose that men so sensible as the
primitive Saronides, would have held their schools and colleges in places
more adapted to a northern climate than their favourite oak groves.</p></div>

According to Welch genealogists, Arthur left no son: and I must
therefore invite the believer in Merlin's prophecy to suppose that it
was by a daughter that Arthur's line was continued, and the royalty
of Britain restored to the Cymrian kings, through the House of Tudor;
from the accession of which House may indeed be dated both the final
and cordial amalgamation of the Welch with the English, and the rise
of that power over the destinies of the civilized world, which England
has since established. The reader will pardon me, by the way, if I
have somewhat perplexed him, now and then, by a similarity between
the names of "Genevieve" and "Genevra." Both are used by the
writers of the French Fabliaux as synonymous with Guenever; and the
more shrewd will perhaps perceive that the reason why the name of
Lancelot's mistress has been made almost identical with that of
Arthur's, is to vindicate the fidelity of the Cymrian Queen Guenever
from that scandal which the levity of French romance has most
improperly cast upon it, in connection with Lancelot. It is to be
presumed that those ancient slanderers were misled by the confusion
of names, and that it was his own Genevra, and not Arthur's Genevieve,
who received Lancelot's homage.&mdash;But indeed my Lancelot is altogether
a different personage from the Lancelot represented in the Fabliaux as
Arthur's nephew.</p></div>

which can never, perhaps, be critically solved&mdash;viz., whether the true business
of the poet be to delight or to instruct;&mdash;and he will therefore be disposed to
forgive me if he recognize certain thoughts or expressions freely borrowed
from the various poets, who may be said to represent either side of the question.
Among the moderns, <span class="smcap">Schiller</span> especially has suggested ideas and
illustrations on behalf of the more earnest creed professed by <span class="smcap">Lykegenes</span>&mdash;while
<span class="smcap">Goethe</span> has been pressed to the aid of <span class="smcap">Anthios</span>. The Greek poets have
here and there suggested a line on either side. After this general acknowledgment

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Section I.</span></p>

<p>The Ideal World&mdash;Its realm is everywhere around us&mdash;Its inhabitants are
the immortal personifications of all beautiful thoughts&mdash;To that World we
attain by the repose of the senses.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Section II.</span></p>

<p>Our dreams belong to the Ideal&mdash;The diviner love for which youth sighs, not
attainable in life&mdash;But the pursuit of that love, beyond the world of the senses,
purifies the soul, and awakes the Genius&mdash;Instances in Petrarch&mdash;Dante.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Section III.</span></p>

<p>Genius, lifting its life to the Ideal becomes itself a pure idea&mdash;It must comprehend
all existence: all human sins and sufferings&mdash;But, in comprehending,
it transmutes them&mdash;The Poet in his twofold being&mdash;The actual and the ideal&mdash;The
influence of Genius over the sternest realities of earth&mdash;Over our
passions&mdash;wars and superstitions&mdash;Its identity is with human progress&mdash;Its
agency, even where unacknowledged, is universal.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Section IV.</span></p>

<p>Forgiveness to the errors of our benefactors.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Section V.</span></p>

<p>The Ideal is not confined to Poets&mdash;Algernon Sydney recognizes his Ideal in
liberty, and believes in its triumph where the mere practical man could behold
but its ruins&mdash;Yet liberty in this world must ever be an Ideal, and the land that
it promises can be found but in death.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Section VI.</span></p>

<p>Yet all have two escapes into the Ideal World; viz. Memory and Hope&mdash;Example
of Hope in youth, however excluded from action and desire&mdash;Napoleon's
son.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Section VII.</span></p>

<p>Example of Memory as leading to the Ideal&mdash;Amidst life, however humble,
and in a mind however ignorant&mdash;the village widow.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Section VIII.</span></p>

<p>Hence in Hope, Memory, and Prayer, all of us are Poets.</p>

<h4>FOOTNOTES</h4>
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_215" id="Footnote_A_215"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_215"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> These Poems, with one exception, have received but little alteration since
they were first composed, and are taken from the little volume called
"Eva, &amp;c." The Poem called "<span class="smcap">The Ideal World</span>," to which I refer as an
exception, appeared in a much ruder form in the earlier editions of the
"Pilgrims of the Rhine," to which it served as a Preface. I recast, and,
indeed, re-wrote it for the last edition of that work, from which (with slight
corrections, and the omission of the verses which connected the poem with the
tale by which it was first accompanied) it is now reprinted.</p></div>

compliment paid by Prior to one equally ambitious of either distinction; viz.
Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_221" id="Footnote_A_221"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_221"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> The celebrated comparison between Sculpture and the Ancient Painting
and the Modern Dramatic Poetry, is not applicable to Euripides, who has a
warmth and colour of passion which few, indeed, of the moderns have surpassed,
and from which most of the modern writers have mediately, if not
directly, borrowed their most animated conceptions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_222" id="Footnote_B_222"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_222"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> Among the taunting accusations which Aristophanes, in his Comedy of
the Frogs, lavishes upon Euripides, through the medium of &AElig;schylus, is that
of having introduced female love upon the stage! &AElig;schylus, indeed, is made,
very inconsistently, considering his Clytemnestra (Ran. 1. 1042) to declare
that he does not know that <i>he</i> ever represented a single woman in love. At a
previous period of the comedy, Euripides is also ridiculed, through a boast
ironically assigned to his own lips, for having debased Tragedy by the introduction
of domestic interest&mdash;(household things, &#959;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#912;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;). Upon
these and similar charges have later critics, partly in England, especially in
Germany, sought by duller diatribes to perpetuate a spirit of depreciation
against the only ancient tragic poet who has vitally influenced the later stage.
The true merit of Euripides is seen in the very ridicule of Aristophanes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_223" id="Footnote_A_223"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_223"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> "Wise Sophocles, wiser Euripides, wisest of all, Socrates," was the well-known
decision of the Delphian Oracle. Yet the wisdom of Euripides was not
in the philosophical sentences with which he often mars the true philosophy
of the drama. His wisdom is his pathos.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_224" id="Footnote_B_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_224"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> Gibbon, after a powerful sketch of the fraud, the corruption, and the vices
of George the Cappadocian, thus concludes:&mdash;"The odious stranger, disguising
every circumstance of time and place, assumed the mask of a martyr, a saint,
and a Christian hero; and the infamous George of Cappadocia has been transformed
into the renowned St. George of England, the patron of arms, of
chivalry, and the garter."&mdash;<i>Gibbon's Decline and Fall</i>, vol. iv. c. xxiii.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No collection of prose fictions, by any single author, contains the same variety of
experience&mdash;the same amplitude of knowledge and thought&mdash;the same combination
of opposite extremes, harmonized by an equal mastership of art; here, lively and
sparkling fancies; there, vigorous passion or practical wisdom. These works abound
in illustrations that teach benevolence to the rich, and courage to the poor; they
glow with the love of freedom; they speak a sympathy with all high aspirations, and
all manly struggle; and where, in their more tragic portraitures, they depict the
dread images of guilt and woe, they so clear our judgment by profound analysis, while
they move our hearts by terror or compassion, that we learn to detect and stifle in
ourselves the evil thought which we see gradually unfolding itself into the guilty deed."&mdash;<i>Extract
